# Dataset attributes and metadata.
The attributes I found interesting for our dataset is age, country, state, and other comments.
A normal value example for age is 44. A noisy value example for age is "old enough".
A normal value example for country is USA. A noisy value example for country is us.
A normal value example for state is CO. A noisy value example is colorado.
For other comments, I don't think there are any normal or noisy values. Because they are just user's subjective opinions. However,
we do need to find somthing to do with these inputs.
