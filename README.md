## Project Objective:
The main objective for this project is to have an accurate, consistent and complete data from the Candy Hierarchy Survey dataset. There are many issues that needs to be fixed within the dataset in order to make the dataset ready for data analysis. We plan to work on removing some errors such as typos, inconsistent capitalization and mislabeled classes. Eventhough most of the surveys were multiple choice answers allowing the participants to pick thier answer, Some of the questions including the ones asking for the participants information were open questions allowing them to answer by typing their answers which lead to more Structural errors. We will work on those columns by filtering and fixing the common errors. There are also many missing data which needs to be fixed in order to have a complete data. We will also identify feature engineering opportunity if there are any.
